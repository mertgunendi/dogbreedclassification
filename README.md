# Dog Breed Classification Project

## Overview
This project is a deep learning-based image classification system designed to identify and categorize dog breeds. Leveraging transfer learning and a pre-trained ResNet50V2 model, the system achieves accurate predictions.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the [Dog Breed Identification dataset](link_to_dataset) containing images of various dog breeds. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and test sets.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and testing.
  - `01_data_preprocessing.ipynb`
  - `02_model_training.ipynb`
  - `03_testing_and_prediction.ipynb`
- `src/`: Python scripts containing utility functions and model definitions.
- `predicted_labels.csv`: CSV file with predictions for the test set.
- `Predicted_Images/`: Folder with images categorized by predicted breeds.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dog-breed-classification.git
   cd dog-breed-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Navigate to the notebooks/ directory.
Execute the Jupyter notebooks in the following order:
01_data_preprocessing.ipynb
02_model_training.ipynb
03_testing_and_prediction.ipynb
Results
The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set. Prediction results are saved in predicted_labels.csv, and corresponding images are organized in the Predicted_Images/ directory.
